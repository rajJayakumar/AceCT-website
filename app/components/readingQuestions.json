            "passage": "The summer of 1949 was the hottest Eliza could remember, and it wasn't just the sun that burned. The heat seemed to seep into every conversation with her Aunt Margaret, who had moved in after Eliza’s mother passed. The old farmhouse smelled of varnish and violets, but nothing masked the tension. Eliza missed the freedom of her mother’s quiet presence. Margaret, with her pressed blouses and sharp opinions, had plans for Eliza—music lessons, etiquette classes, and a 'sensible' future.\n\nEach evening, Eliza escaped to the orchard. Beneath the second apple tree from the right, her mother’s favorite, she would sketch animals and daydream. One day, she noticed a gray rabbit with one torn ear hopping around the roots. Eliza named him Patch. He became her confidant.\n\nOne sticky evening, Margaret found Eliza under the tree. “What do you think you’re doing?” she asked, voice tight.\n\n“I’m drawing,” Eliza replied, shielding her sketchpad.\n\n“Drawing rabbits won’t get you into Radcliffe.”\n\nEliza’s heart pounded. “I don’t want Radcliffe.”\n\nMargaret’s lips tightened. “You’ll thank me someday.”\n\nThat night, Eliza opened her mother’s trunk and found a worn journal. On the last page, in her mother’s faded script, were the words: *Let her be who she is. That’s the best future anyone can have.*\n\nThe next morning, Eliza took her sketchpad to the orchard and began her most ambitious drawing yet—Patch beneath the tree, surrounded by blooming wildflowers.",
